* Current directory - .
* Parent directory - ..
* Navigating directory - cd
* How to find all keyboard shortcuts for the file page? (less)

# To run R commands in the shell, use:

# How about as an executable?
* ./hello.R doesn't work
* Add chmod +x hello.R makes it an exectuable

# Some caution
* Removing files is _for real_
* However, if you remove git, it's not such a big deal

# Shell Commands
* sdin > file name (redirect)
* stdin  >> file name (append)
* stdin | command (pipe)
